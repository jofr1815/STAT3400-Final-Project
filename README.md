# STAT3400-Final-Project

Final Project for STAT 3400 - Applied Regression

This repository contains the R-Markdown and knitted HTML document for my final project, an analysis of fivethirtyeight's non-voter dataset.

Goals:
  1. Discover which variables and specific levels influence someones likelyhood to vote
  2. Build and test a voter likelyhood prediction model

More information can be found the the RMD and HTML documents.
